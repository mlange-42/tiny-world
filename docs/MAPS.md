# Tiny World Scenarios

Tiny World can be played on built-in as well as on user-provided maps or scenarios.
We call them scenarios, because each one can have its own probabilities for random terrain "cards".

**Built-in scenarios** are packaged with the executable, and can be found in the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/mlange-42/tiny-world) under [`data/maps`](https://github.com/mlange-42/tiny-world/tree/main/data/maps).

**User scenarios** must be placed in a folder `maps` next to the executable.

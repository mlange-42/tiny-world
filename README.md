## Usage

### Play in browser

You can play Tiny World in a web browser [here](https://mlange-42.github.io/tiny-world/).

### Play locally

Until there is a first official release, you need to clone the repository and run the game with [Go](https://go.dev):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mlange-42/tiny-world.git
cd tiny-world
go run .
```

## Playing

In the toolbar on the right, the top items are **buildings** that can be bought by the player for resources.
The **natural features** in the lower part appear randomly and are replenished when placed by the player.

* Middle mouse button / mouse wheel: pan and zoom.
* Space: pause / resume.
* PageUp / PageDown: speed up / slow down.
* F11: toggle fullscreen.

Most UI controls have tooltips. Read them carefully!
